# AI Application Specification Language (AIASL) Documentation

## Introduction
AIASL is a YAML-based language for defining applications to be built by AI systems. It provides a structured way to specify all aspects of an application, from architecture to deployment.

## Getting Started

### Basic Structure
Every AIASL specification requires at least:
```yaml
version: "1.0"
metadata:
  title: "My Application"
architecture:
  type: "monolithic"
```

### Complete Example
Here's a simple web application specification:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
metadata:
  title: "Todo Application"
  description: "Simple task management system"
  domain: "productivity"
  tags: ["web", "tasks"]
  status: "draft"

architecture:
  type: "fullstack"
  pattern: "frontend-backend"
  layers:
    presentation:
      type: "web"
      framework: "react"
      components:
        - "TaskList"
        - "TaskForm"
    application:
      type: "rest-api"
      services: ["TaskService"]
      apis: ["TaskAPI"]

infrastructure:
  hosting:
    type: "cloud"
    provider: "aws"
  frontend:
    framework: "react"
    version: "18.0"
  backend:
    language: "nodejs"
    framework: "express"
  database:
    type: "nosql"
    engine: "mongodb"

components:
  - type: "page"
    name: "TaskListPage"
    props:
      - name: "filter"
        type: "string"
        default: "all"
    state:
      - name: "tasks"
        type: "array"
        initial: []

dataModel:
  entities:
    - name: "Task"
      fields:
        - name: "title"
          type: "string"
          required: true
        - name: "completed"
          type: "boolean"
          default: false
```

## Key Sections

### Metadata
Used for project information and tracking:
```yaml
metadata:
  title: "Customer Portal"
  author: "Development Team"
  status: "review"
```

### Architecture
Defines application structure:
```yaml
architecture:
  type: "microservices"
  pattern: "eventDriven"
  layers:
    presentation:
      type: "web"
      framework: "vue"
```

### Infrastructure
Specifies technical requirements:
```yaml
infrastructure:
  hosting:
    type: "hybrid"
    provider: "azure"
  database:
    type: "sql"
    engine: "postgresql"
```

### Components
Defines UI and service components:
```yaml
components:
  - type: "component"
    name: "UserProfile"
    props:
      - name: "userId"
        type: "string"
        required: true
    methods:
      - name: "updateProfile"
        params: ["profileData"]
```

### Actions
Defines specific operations that components can perform:
```yaml
actions:
  - name: "exportUserData"
    type: "file"
    component: "UserProfile"
    trigger:
      type: "method"
      source: "handleExport"
    input:
      schema:
        format: enum[csv|pdf]
        filters: object
    output:
      type: "file"
      format: "csv"
    permissions:
      roles: ["admin", "data_manager"]
```

### Workflows
Describes sequences of actions and business processes:
```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "userOnboarding"
    trigger:
      type: "event"
      source: "user_registered"
    steps:
      - name: "sendWelcomeEmail"
        type: "action"
        action: "send_email"
        next:
          success: "createProfile"
      - name: "createProfile"
        type: "action"
        action: "setup_profile"
    error_handling:
      retry:
        enabled: true
        max_attempts: 3
```

### Component Behaviors
Specifies how components react to events and manage state:
```yaml
behaviors:
  - component: "SearchBar"
    type: "interaction"
    triggers:
      user:
        - event: "input_change"
          action: "performSearch"
          debounce: 300
    state:
      read:
        scope: "local"
        path: "search_results"
```

### State Management
Definds global and shared application state:
```yaml
state:
  global:
    - name: "userPreferences"
      type: "object"
      scope: "user"
      persistence: true
  shared:
    - name: "activeFilters"
      type: "object"
      scope: ["SearchBar", "ResultList"]
      sync: true
```

## Common Patterns

### Action Patterns

#### Data Export
```yaml
actions:
  - name: "exportData"
    type: "file"
    component: "DataGrid"
    trigger:
      type: "method"
      source: "handleExport"
    steps:
      - name: "prepareData"
        type: "process"
      - name: "generateFile"
        type: "transform"
    state:
      success:
        notify: ["ExportStatus"]
```

#### Notification System
```yaml
actions:
  - name: "sendNotification"
    type: "communication"
    component: "NotificationCenter"
    trigger:
      type: "event"
      source: "system_event"
    input:
      schema:
        message: string
        type: enum[info|warning|error]
```

### Workflow Patterns

#### User Registration
```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "userRegistration"
    trigger:
      type: "event"
      source: "signup_submitted"
    steps:
      - name: "validateData"
        type: "action"
        next:
          success: "createAccount"
          failure: "showErrors"
      - name: "createAccount"
        type: "action"
        next:
          success: "sendWelcome"
    error_handling:
      compensation:
        enabled: true
```

#### Payment Processing
```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "processPayment"
    trigger:
      type: "event"
      source: "checkout_initiated"
    steps:
      - name: "validateCard"
        type: "action"
      - name: "processCharge"
        type: "action"
      - name: "createOrder"
        type: "action"
    state:
      tracking: true
      history: true
```

### Behavior Patterns

#### Form Handling
```yaml
behaviors:
  - component: "RegistrationForm"
    type: "interaction"
    triggers:
      user:
        - event: "field_change"
          action: "validateField"
        - event: "form_submit"
          action: "submitForm"
    state:
      write:
        scope: "local"
        validation:
          required: ["email", "password"]
```

#### Real-time Updates
```yaml
behaviors:
  - component: "LiveDashboard"
    type: "data"
    triggers:
      system:
        - event: "data_update"
          action: "refreshData"
          throttle: 1000
    state:
      read:
        scope: "shared"
        path: "dashboardMetrics"
```

    - Use PascalCase for component names
    - Keep names descriptive and consistent

2. Version Control
    - Always specify AIASL version
    - Document specification changes
    - Use semantic versioning

3. Documentation
    - Include clear descriptions
    - Document all custom extensions
    - Maintain API documentation

4. Validation
    - Validate against schema before use
    - Check all required fields
    - Verify relationship integrity

## Common Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
```yaml
architecture:
  type: "microservices"
  pattern: "eventDriven"
  communications:
    protocols: ["grpc", "rest"]
    async: true
```

### Authentication Setup
```yaml
security:
  authentication:
    type: "oauth"
    provider: "auth0"
    config:
      domain: "example.auth0.com"
      clientId: "${CLIENT_ID}"
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
deployment:
  environments:
    - name: "staging"
      config:
        scaling:
          min: 2
          max: 4
  pipeline:
    stages: ["build", "test", "deploy"]
    triggers:
      - branch: "main"
        event: "push"
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Schema Validation Errors
    - Check required fields
    - Verify enum values
    - Validate data types

2. Relationship Issues
    - Ensure referenced entities exist
    - Check relationship types
    - Verify cascade settings

3. Extension Problems
    - Validate extension schema
    - Check version compatibility
    - Verify extension dependencies
